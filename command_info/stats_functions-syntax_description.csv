Command_Name,Supported functions and syntax,Description
avg,avg(X),Returns the average of the values in the field X.
count,count(X),"Returns the number of occurrences where the field that you specify contains any value (is not empty. You can also count the occurrences of a specific value in the field by using the eval command with the count function. For example: count eval(field_name=""value"")."
distinct_count,distinct_count(X),Returns the count of distinct values in the field X.
estdc,estdc(X),Returns the estimated count of the distinct values in the field X.
estdc_error,estdc_error(X),Returns the theoretical error of the estimated count of the distinct values in the field X. The error represents a ratio of the absolute_value(estimate_distinct_count - real_distinct_count)/real_distinct_count.
max,max(X),"Returns the maximum value of the field X. If the values of X are non-numeric, the maximum value is found using lexicographical ordering. This function processes field values as numbers if possible, otherwise processes field values as strings."
mean,mean(X),Returns the arithmetic mean of the field X.
median,median(X),Returns the middle-most value of the field X.
min,min(X),"Returns the minimum value of the field X. If the values of X are non-numeric, the minimum value is found using lexicographical ordering."
mode,mode(X),Returns the most frequent value of the field X.
percentile,percentile<X>(Y),Returns the X-th percentile value of the numeric field Y. Valid values of X are integers from 1 to 99.
range,range(X),Returns the difference between the maximum and minimum values of the field X ONLY IF the values of X are numeric.
stdev,stdev(X),Returns the sample standard deviation of the field X.
stdevp,stdevp(X),Returns the population standard deviation of the field X.
sum,sum(X),Returns the sum of the values of the field X.
sumsq,sumsq(X),Returns the sum of the squares of the values of the field X.
var,var(X),Returns the sample variance of the field X.
varp,varp(X),Returns the population variance of the field X.
first,first(X),"Returns the first seen value of the field X. In general, the first seen value of the field is the most recent instance of this field, relative to the input order of events into the stats command."
last,last(X),"Returns the last seen value of the field X. In general, the last seen value of the field is the oldest instance of this field relative to the input order of events into the stats command."
list,list(X),Returns a list of up to 100 values of the field X as a multivalue entry. The order of the values reflects the order of input events.
values,values(X),Returns the list of all distinct values of the field X as a multivalue entry. The order of the values is lexicographical.
earliest,earliest(X),Returns the chronologically earliest (oldest) seen occurrence of a value of a field X.
earliest_time,earliest_time(X),"Returns the UNIX time of the earliest (oldest) occurrence of a value of the field. Used in conjunction with earliest(x), latest(x), and latest_time(x) to calculate the rate of increase for an accumulating counter."
latest,latest(X),Returns the chronologically latest (most recent) seen occurrence of a value of a field X.
latest_time,latest_time(X),"Returns the UNIX time of the latest (most recent) occurrence of a value of the field. Used in conjunction with earliest(x), earliest_time(x), and latest(x) to calculate the rate of increase for an accumulating counter."
per_day,per_day(X),"Returns the values of field X, or eval expression X, for each day."
per_hour,per_hour(X),"Returns the values of field X, or eval expression X, for each hour."
per_minute,per_minute(X),"Returns the values of field X, or eval expression X, for each minute."
per_second,per_second(X),"Returns the values of field X, or eval expression X, for each second."
rate,rate(X),"Returns the per-second rate change of the value of the field. Represents (latest(X) - earliest(X)) / (latest_time(X) - earliest_time(X)) Requires the earliest(X) and latest(X) values of the field to be numerical, and the earliest_time(X) and latest_time(X) values to be different."
